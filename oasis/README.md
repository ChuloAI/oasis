# Oasis Readme

## Local LLamas on VSCode

### Installation
1. Install text-generation-web-ui, start it with API: https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui
2. Start FastAPI web server from repository: https://github.com/paolorechia/oasis
3. Install this VSCode plugin
4. Use it!

This is still in development, highly experimental. For now we depend on the FastAPI server, the idea is to push all the prompts to the extension config. Unfortunately, I'm a bit too low on time at the moment to do this properly, feel free to contribute with a PR if you'd like :)
